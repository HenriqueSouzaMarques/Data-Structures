# Data Structures Repository

This repository provides Data Structures (C language) using concepts, such as Abstract Type of Data (ATD), acquired from the SCC0202 - Algorithms and Data Structures I - ICMC/USP taught by Prof. Marcelo Manzato.

## Covered topics:
The repository covers the following topics:

* Stacks:
    * Linked Implementation
    * Sequential Implementation
* Queues: 
    * Linked Implementation
    * Sequential Implementation
* Linked Lists:
    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
* Binary Trees:
    * Generic Binary Tree
    * Search Binary Tree
    * AVL Tree

These topics serve as a foundation for understanding and working with data structures.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects.
